Change Log


0.5.2:
Add matcap blending with a mask, you can now change the color of your matcaps
Add preprocessor variables to help reduce compile time
Add second level of shadow for artistic freedom
Reorganized shader code files (You will need to delete the folder for this to not break)

0.5.1:
Disable probe light direction calculation
Alter dithering curve
Change transparent blending mode to sanitize alpha channel in color buffer

0.5.0:
Remove added duplicate code I added while trying to fix the bug last update
Added option under panosphere effect to apply the effect to emission
Moved Rainbowing down to effects
Added new rainbow modes
Added collapsible interface to blending options
Added subsurface scattering
Added local light direction in object space for light override
Explicitly define alpha value in opaque render mode
Change light probe sample coordinates
Updated Unity to 2017.4.28f1

0.4.5.2:
Lighting sanity check implemented
Allow interface to collapse
Fix slight bug in the editor where switching to transparent wouldn't actually make the material transparent

0.4.5.1:
Fixed AMD crash

0.4.5:
Tweaked light attenuation, shadows now compute independently
Shadows now render properly on the backface of materials
Under cutout, you can now use dithered transparency, you can still set the cutoff point (slightly buggy)
Transparent materials now have shadows, using shadow dithering

0.4.4.7:
Added ability to cull front
Added ability to flip backface normals
Cleaned up code a bit
Removed checkbox for shadowing.  The slider for shadow intensity is now always shown. This is set to 0.75 for old materials, I'd recommend bumping it up to 1.
Removed extraneous unnecessary keywords

0.4.4.6:
Removed outline keywords
Consolidated duplicate code
Fixed a bug in the editor where the pulse emission settings wouldn't show up

0.4.4.5:
Added unlit option
Tweaked rainbow to allow only emission to rainbow
Overbright protection now defaults to off, and has more fine grained control
Gamma correction is no longer a keyword.  This will cause issues with upgraded materials.  You'll have to drag the slider to the left to turn it off.
Pulse Sleep and Shade emission keywords are now material properties.
Minor tweaks

0.4.4.4:
Inspector now doesn't half draw when a property is updated based on an old keyword
Inspector will now only show you when a texture's clamp mode is set incorrectly

0.4.4.3:
Changed rainbowing to not use a keyword and instead rely on a material property.  This will fix the issues of unwanted rainbowing.
Fixed a bug in the editor that was causing mismatch errors.

0.4.4.2:
Removed unused 4th field in the Light Direction property
Removed 3 more keywords!!!
Consolidated a bit of code in the editor

0.4.4.1:
Fixed editor bug where sliders would disappear after leaving the editor

0.4.4:
Fixed reflected light in refraction shader
Added batching toggle in case batching causes issues
Rewrote entire GUI for cleaner more efficient code, a few things are moved around and should make more sense
Added support for outline color atlases.  These can be used with either tinted or colored outlines.  I suggest setting your outline color to white if using an atlas

0.4.3:
Added deferred pass for screenspace effects
Added refraction and chromatic aborration
Removed unneeded code
Changed labels on the sphere maps from HxW to WxH, this should be less confusing

0.4.2:
Added support for reflection probes
Adjusted vertex lights algorithm for more consistent lighting
Adjusted the algorithm for the sphere and toon atlas maps

0.4.1.3:
Corrected lightmap implementation so it only renders in the base pass
Added support for vertex lights
Fixed screen space overlays
Fixed scaling for encoded atlas coordinates

0.4.1.2:
Added meta pass for lightmap generation
Added support for up to 4 uv maps
Fixed and re-enabled lightmap support
Fixed outlines not being affected by attenuation

0.4.1.1:
Disabled lightmap support until I can fix the bugs in it
Fixed bug where materials would appear black under certain situations

0.4.1:
Added ambient occlusion maps support
Added sphere atlasing
Added lightmap support
Tweaked gamma correction algorithm

0.4.0.1:
Fixed bug where toon map wasn't showing up in the editor.
Fixed compile error.

0.4:
Added texture shadows support.  Models with a shadowed texture and a lit texture will work here.
Added support for multiple toon gradient ramps, all with full color.  This can be used on MMD toon textures, just make sure the toon atlas is set to clamp. This feature is for atlasers.  The red channel in the map corresponds to which toon you're using.
Added a new Auto shadow mode.  Setting this will give a pretty decent shadowed look to the entire material.  This is safe to use for atlassed models, and will work just as well as it does on a non atlassed model.
Specular shouldn't light models up from the other side anymore.

0.3.4.2:
Apparently skipped a number
Upped the cap of the Brightness slider from 1 to 10, this can be used for models with baked highlights.

0.3.4:
Added specular support, use the specular power to adjust, and make sure to set the color to something other than pure black.
Changed Panosphere to Overlays.  Panospheres will still be available, but will be able to be blended in multiple ways.
Added UV scrolling overlays, these use the same new blend modes as panospheres, enjoy!
Issues:
Interface might "forget" you have a panosphere set.  Click the Overlay Mode dropdown to select again.

0.3.3.1:
Removed a warning in the editor

0.3.3:
Added stencil support
Added lighting color options
Added custom blending support

0.3.2:
Added ability to shade your emission like the rest of your model
Added ability to turn off emission below a certain light level
Added gamma correction, this can help fix washed out models

0.3.1:
Added another level of transparent fix since one seems not to have been enough, I may add a few more in the future.  This will remove your fix setting in the inspector
Spotlights fixed, lighting should look amaze in forward add, directional lights beware
Shadow intensity slider will no longer work, at least for now, functionality will be determined when I find out if it's needed

0.3.0:
Added a fix for light textures not drawing correctly, this affects point lights, spot lights, and shadow casts
Now you can disable the overbright protection code I added, this is recommended when you bump the shadow cast intensity up
Panospheres added, you can define a panosphere and even overlay it
Known Issues:
Flat panospheres, screen mode, don't work at all, do not use

0.2.8.3:
Actually fixed outline lighting, turns out it only was affected in certain worlds.

0.2.8.2:
Fixed a bug with outlines, especially colored outlines, they should appear more colored and less black now.
Fixed a bug where HSB mode would only apply to the forward pass, this should give more consistent colors.

0.2.8.1:
Fixed unity package, forgot to include the editor, sorry guys!

0.2.8:
You can now oversaturate your models! Saturation boost added.
HSB mode! Now you can change the color of your textures completely within your materials!

0.2.7:
Fixed how sphere textures apply, should look better than before this broke (thanks Unity for that)
Improve support for double sided transparent textures, will now render in two separate passes

0.2.6:
Bug fix: Certain materials that had a redefinition error are now fixed

0.2.5:
Changed info text for toon textures and shadow ramps
(Breaking change) Split shader in order to specify explicit render queue settings for VRChat
Transparency Fix will set render queue up in order to combat render queue fights in VRChat
Shadows now appear on opaque and cutout render modes
Lighting hacks adjusted and improved, fixed
Lighting hacks are now hybrid by default
Lighting hacks now have an override for realtime lighting

0.2.4:
Added lighting hack choice
None is normal lighting, will work anywhere
VRChat is for worlds with light direction coordinates 0,0,0 which causes everything to be shadowed and I don't want that.
Static lets you choose a static light coordinate, relative to the model.  This will work everywhere but may look incorrect

2018/6/28
Lighting hack is now much more subtle
Added description text to most controls

2018/6/26
Added outline modes!
Screenspace outlines!
Started writing this log in the first place, I should have done this a long time ago
